<p><strong>Evert Jan Lammerts is secretary of ERA since 2007</strong></p>
<p>I am working as a senior ecologist at Staatsbosbeheer. This organization is commissioned by the Dutch government to manage a sizeable amount of the nature reserves in the Netherland. My focus is on the landscape ecology of coastal areas, especially on the way characteristic species and related biodiversity relate to natural processes such as sedimentation, erosion and changing flows of groundwater and surface water (fresh, brackisch and salt).</p>
