<p><strong>Ren&eacute;e M. Bekker is chair of ERA since 2007</strong></p>
<p>I am affiliated to the University of Groningen, where I worked since 1991 at the Plant Ecology department as community ecologist and from where I joined the Groningen Institute of Archaeology since 2012 as associate member of palaeobotany.<br />With ERA we can bring knowledge and people together to create and support opportunities for applied restoration ecology projects with our knowledge and we gather more insights in the functioning of natural communities. I am convinced that a better understanding of our natural environment will result in a better care and a more sustainable use of these resources.</p>
